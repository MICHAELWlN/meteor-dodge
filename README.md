# meteor-dodge
First game project using scratch. Player controls a rocketship while dodging meteors.

## What It Does:
You control a spaceship using the left and right arrow keys and attempt to avoid falling meteors. If a meteor hits your spaceship, the game ends with a sound effect and a message.

## What I learned
-Conditionals and loops to control behavior
-Detecting collision in Scratch
-Using events like when "when green flag clicked"
-Basic game design structure

## How to Play
-Press the Green Flag
-Use left arrow key to move left, right arrow key to move right
-Don't get hit by the meteor
